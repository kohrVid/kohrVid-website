  About

%p
  My name is Jessica Ete (pronounced "eh-tay"...you may see this written with
  accent aigus elsewhere because no-one knows how to say it). I was born and
  raised in London. Languages, frameworks and tools I've worked with in the past
  include:

    I'm actually on
    #{ link_to "LinkedIn", "https://uk.linkedin.com/pub/jessica-ete/61/21b/323", title: "¯\_(ツ)_/¯" }&nbsp;
    but I still haven't really worked out what I'm supposed to use it for. I
    worked in IT for a few years after sixth-form but, like, I don't anymore.

        I listen to music sometimes - mostly just alternative or whatever passed

        Last year I took up dance, specifically
        &nbsp;#{ link_to "zouk", "https://www.facebook.com/zouklambada.co.uk/?_fb_noscript=1" }
        &nbsp;as I know a #{ link_to "great teacher", "https://deliveroo.engineering/authors/kriselda-rabino/" }.
        &nbsp;I apparently no longer suck at it which, considering how rubbish I was at PE as a kid, is pretty good!

        I know a mouse-hunter named #{ link_to "QT", image_path("QT.jpg") }.
        &nbsp;Saying that I own him makes me feel guilty but, like, I did pay for him
        once. I <em>think</em> he likes me

        I have a laptop at home named #{ link_to "kandiStryp", image_path("meAndkandiStryp.jpg") }

        Back when I was poor and in between jobs, I would occasionally follow
        &nbsp;#{ link_to "corvids", image_path("corvid.jpg") } and take pictures of
        them #{ link_to "running away", image_path("running.jpg") } on my smartphone.
        &nbsp;I sort of miss it a little
