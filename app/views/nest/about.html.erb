<span><h1>About</h1>
<p>I'm twenty-three and currently based in London, though this is likely to change. I worked in IT support for over three years before making the decision to change careers and before <i>that</i>, <%= link_to "I did the IB at school and didn't fail my GCSEs", "https://uk.linkedin.com/pub/jessica-ete/61/21b/323", title: "I know some people really like LinkedIn" %>. I actually used to support Windows 7 users but now develop all of my sites in <%= link_to "Debian", "http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=penguinista", title: "penguinista", target: "blank" %>. The speed with which Ruby on Rails sites can be created and deployed as well as the vibrant community surrounding Ruby in general were what drew me to the programming language initially.</p>
<p>I'm not <%= link_to "French", "https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%A9t%C3%A9" %> (sorry) but I am an INTP (which I'm actually rather <%= link_to "proud", "http://www.celebritytypes.com/intp.php" %> of). I listen to music sometimes - mostly just alternative or whatever passed for <%= link_to "punk", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emo#Mainstream_popularity:_2000s" %> back when I was thirteen. I have a <%= link_to "Twitter account", "https://twitter.com/kohrVid" %> if you'd like to follow/tweet.</p></span>
