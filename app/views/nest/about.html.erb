<h1>About</h1>
<p>I'm twenty-three, born and raised in London. In a former life I worked in IT support, mostly supporting Windows users, for over three years before changing course in order to develop apps using a <%= link_to "Debian", "http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=penguinista", title: "penguinista", target: "blank" %> machine. Before <i>that</i>, <%= link_to "I went to school", "https://uk.linkedin.com/pub/jessica-ete/61/21b/323", title: "I know some people really like LinkedIn so here's my profile" %> and <i>before that</i>..... </p>

<p>The speed with which Ruby on Rails sites can be created and deployed as well as the vibrant community surrounding Ruby in general were what drew me to the programming language initially. I've created sites that run on MySQL2 and PostgreSQL databases, have worked with gems such as Devise, CarrierWave and Braintree and have deployed applications to AWS and Heroku in the past. Though I can do fullstack development (and have designed test sites using Twitter Bootstrap, ZURB Foundation and - as in the case of this website - have even produced designs without an established CSS framework), I definitely prefer to do backend work where possible.</p>
